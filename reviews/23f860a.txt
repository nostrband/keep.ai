ANALYSIS
--------
This is a documentation-only commit that updates the implementation plan to track
completed cleanup work. The documentation serves as a changelog/history of work done.

ISSUES FOUND
------------

ISSUE #1: Documentation Inaccuracy (Minor)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Severity: Low
Type: Documentation mismatch

The documentation claims /apps/server/src/server.ts was cleaned up as part of this
work, but that change was actually made in a DIFFERENT commit (d77deb5 - "Remove
debug console.log in file get endpoint") which was committed 3 minutes EARLIER.

Commit timeline:
- d77deb5 (20:28:34) - Actual server.ts change
- 62a37dd (20:30:31) - Web app console.log cleanup (the code changes)
- 23f860a (20:31:05) - This documentation commit

The documentation in 23f860a incorrectly groups the server.ts change with the web
app changes from 62a37dd, even though server.ts was changed in d77deb5.

Impact: Minor - the work WAS done, just in a different commit. The documentation
is slightly misleading about which commit made which change.

PROPOSALS
---------

PROPOSAL #1: No action required
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This is a minor documentation inaccuracy that doesn't affect functionality.
The implementation plan serves as a high-level tracking document, not a precise
git history. The overall claim that the files were cleaned up is accurate.

However, if strict documentation accuracy is desired, the entry could be split
to reference the correct commits for each file. This is likely not worth the effort.

MINOR OBSERVATIONS
------------------
1. The "Last Updated" timestamp just says "2026-01-16" without time, which is
   appropriate for a high-level document.

2. The documentation correctly reflects that 6 files were cleaned in commit
   62a37dd plus 1 file (server.ts) was cleaned earlier = 7 files total.

VERDICT: APPROVED (with minor documentation inaccuracy noted)

================================================================================
ISSUE REVIEW
================================================================================
- Issue #1 (Documentation inaccuracy) - skipped (minor, work was done just in different commit)
