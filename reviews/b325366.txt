=======================
Title: Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with sandbox.ts cleanup
Author: Claude Agent
Date: 2026-01-16

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
------------------
This commit updates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to document the sandbox.ts cleanup performed in the previous commit (4799ac4). Changes:

1. Updated the "Last Updated" timestamp in the header to include "removed debug console.log from sandbox.ts"

2. Added a new completed task entry under section 15 (Code Cleanup):
   - [x] **Remove console.log from sandbox.ts** (COMPLETED 2026-01-16)
   - File: `/packages/agent/src/sandbox/sandbox.ts`
   - Lines 185-186 had always-on debug logging for result and state after every sandbox execution

CONTEXT
-------
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md serves as a living document tracking the project's implementation progress toward v1. It includes completed tasks, ongoing work, and planned improvements organized by priority.

ASSESSMENT
----------
This is a documentation-only commit that accurately records the sandbox.ts cleanup. The line numbers (185-186) mentioned match the actual location of the removed code before cleanup.

ISSUES FOUND
------------

Issue #1: Incorrect File Path in Existing Documentation
Severity: Low
Location: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md line 450 (not introduced by this commit, but relevant context)

The documentation contains an incorrect path for audio-explain.ts:
- States: `/packages/agent/src/ai-tools/audio-explain.ts`
- Actual: `/packages/agent/src/tools/audio-explain.ts`

The directory is `tools/`, not `ai-tools/`. The `ai-tools/` directory does not exist.

Note: This issue pre-dates this commit but is worth noting for overall documentation accuracy.

Issue #2: Documentation Drift in packages/db/README.md
Severity: Low (not introduced by this commit)
Location: packages/db/README.md line 125

The README still references the non-existent `getTodoTasks()` method:
```typescript
const todoTasks = await api.taskStore.getTodoTasks();
```

This method was removed previously. While not related to this commit, it indicates documentation maintenance could be improved.

PROPOSALS
---------

Proposal for Issue #1:
Update the audio-explain.ts path in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:
```diff
-- File: `/packages/agent/src/ai-tools/audio-explain.ts`
+- File: `/packages/agent/src/tools/audio-explain.ts`
```

Proposal for Issue #2:
Update packages/db/README.md to use current API methods:
```diff
-- const todoTasks = await api.taskStore.getTodoTasks();
+- const tasks = await api.taskStore.listTasks();
```

OVERALL VERDICT
---------------
Good documentation update. Accurately records the sandbox.ts cleanup. Minor documentation inconsistencies exist elsewhere in the project (not introduced by this commit) that could be addressed separately.
