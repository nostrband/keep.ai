=== POTENTIAL ISSUES ===

None. This is purely an organizational commit that moves completed spec files to a `done/` subdirectory. No code was changed.

=== PROPOSALS ===

None needed. The commit is clean and serves its purpose of organizing the specs directory.

=== VERDICT ===

CLEAN - No issues found. Good housekeeping practice to separate completed specs from active ones.
