POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

1. GOOD commit message: Clearly states what was moved and why (8 phases
   complete, 123 tests passing).

2. FOLLOWS CONVENTION: The project maintains separation between pending specs
   (specs/new/) and completed specs (specs/done/).

3. PROPER TIMING: Commit follows directly after Phase 8 (test suite) completion,
   keeping documentation in sync with implementation.

Simple, correct housekeeping commit. No code changes, no risk.
