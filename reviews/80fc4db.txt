# Review: 80fc4db - Remove 'draft' from scheduler

## Summary

This is a minimal commit that removes the "Draft" marker and status note from the scheduling documentation.

## Changes

**docs/dev/16-scheduling.md** (4 lines changed):
- Changed title from `# 16. Scheduling (Draft)` to `# 16. Scheduling`
- Removed the status line: `> **Status**: Draft proposal for v1. Requires review and refinement.`

## Analysis

This commit follows immediately after a1c638e (23 seconds later based on timestamps), which significantly expanded and refined the scheduling chapter. The removal of the "Draft" marker signals that:

1. The scheduling design is considered stable enough for implementation
2. The comprehensive additions in a1c638e (wakeAt, phase reset, run management, etc.) represent the finalized v1 design
3. The document is now ready to be used as a spec for implementation

## Potential Issues

### Issue 1: Premature Promotion? (Observation, Not Bug)
**Location**: docs/dev/16-scheduling.md
**Observation**: The commit immediately preceding this one (a1c638e) made extensive changes to the document. Marking it "not draft" immediately after a major rewrite might be premature if the changes haven't been reviewed.
**Context**: However, both commits are by Claude Agent, suggesting this is part of a single coherent documentation session. The "draft" removal is the author signaling completion of their work.
**Proposal**: N/A - this is reasonable workflow

## Positive Aspects

1. **Clean Finalization**: Good practice to remove draft markers when design is complete
2. **Atomic Commits**: Separating the content change (a1c638e) from the status update (this commit) makes history cleaner
3. **Clear Signal**: Indicates to implementers that this spec is implementation-ready

## Conclusion

This is a trivial but intentional housekeeping commit. No issues to address.
