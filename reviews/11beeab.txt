- Updated items to reflect actual implementation:
  - "Report Issue" button added to ErrorCard (for auth, permission, network, internal errors)
  - "Report Issue" button added to EscalatedCard (for escalated AI failures)
  - bugReport.ts utility created for generating GitHub issue URLs
  - Pre-filled context includes: error type, service, message, workflow title, timestamp
  - Issue template with sections for reproduction steps
  - Opens GitHub Issues in new tab with pre-filled template
