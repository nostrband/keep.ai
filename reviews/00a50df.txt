=======================
docs: Clean up IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md by condensing completed Priority 1

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
------------------
This commit cleans up IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md by condensing the completed Priority 1
(Maintainer Task Type) section from detailed task lists to a summary reference.

Changes:
- Removes ~190 lines of completed checklist items from Priority 1
- Replaces with single "Completed:" summary line referencing the spec file
- Removes detailed "Implementation Notes" section with dependency graphs
- Replaces with brief "Maintainer Task Type Architecture" section pointing to spec
- Reduces file from 434 lines to 245 lines

ISSUES FOUND
------------

### Issue 1: Lost Implementation Context [LOW]
The detailed implementation notes section was removed, including:
- Version migration strategy details
- Race condition handling explanation
- Thread isolation details
- Context injection for maintainer
- Dependency order diagram

While the spec file reference is added, some context that was useful for understanding
the system is no longer in the primary implementation tracking document.

However, this is intentional - the spec file at specs/maintainer-task-type.md should
contain this information. This is acceptable if the spec is well-maintained.

Proposal: Verify specs/maintainer-task-type.md contains all the removed implementation
details. If not, restore them there rather than in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md.

### Issue 2: No Link to Spec Review [LOW]
The condensed section says "See spec for details" but doesn't indicate whether the
spec file was reviewed/updated to ensure it contains all the implementation details
that were removed.

Proposal: Add a note in the commit message or spec file indicating the spec was
verified to contain implementation details.

POSITIVE ASPECTS
----------------
1. Significant reduction in file size (434 -> 245 lines, ~45% reduction)
2. Completed work moved out of active tracking document
3. Proper reference to spec file for historical details
4. Implementation Notes section retained with condensed architecture overview
5. Maintains focus on remaining work rather than completed work
6. Good doc hygiene - completed items don't need detailed tracking

OVERALL ASSESSMENT
------------------
This is a straightforward documentation cleanup commit. The changes are appropriate
for a completed feature - detailed implementation tracking belongs in the spec file,
not the ongoing implementation plan.

No code changes, no functional impact. Low-risk cleanup.

The only consideration is ensuring specs/maintainer-task-type.md is comprehensive
enough to serve as the reference for the removed details. This wasn't verified in
this review but should be confirmed.

Priority: No action required - this is acceptable documentation cleanup.
