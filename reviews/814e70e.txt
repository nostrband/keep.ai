COMMIT REVIEW: 814e70e - Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md: exec-15 complete, identify next spec

================================================================================
SUMMARY
================================================================================

This commit significantly condenses the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md file after
completing exec-15, reducing it from 329 lines to 48 lines. The detailed
8-phase implementation checklist is removed and replaced with a concise
completion summary, plus notes about potential next work (exec-16).

ISSUES FOUND
================================================================================

ISSUE 1: Historical context lost
Severity: Low
Location: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

The detailed checklist with specific file references and implementation notes
provided valuable historical context for understanding how exec-15 was built.
This information is now lost.

PROPOSAL: Consider archiving detailed implementation plans to a separate file
(e.g., docs/archive/exec-15-implementation.md) rather than deleting them.
This preserves context for future debugging or similar feature development.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE 2: Backward Compatibility Notes removed
Severity: Low
Location: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (removed section)

The "Backward Compatibility Notes" section documented important constraints:
- Existing events with title values preserved
- WorkflowConfig without publishes fails validation
- Topics.publish signature change (no more title)
- Existing handler_runs and mutations unaffected

This information is useful for developers who may encounter migration issues.

PROPOSAL: Consider keeping backward compatibility notes in a central location
(perhaps CHANGELOG.md or a dedicated migrations guide).

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE 3: Missing exec-16 spec location uncertainty
Severity: Very Low
Location: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md:35

The plan references `docs/dev/17-inputs-outputs.md` as the source for exec-16,
but this should be verified to exist. If it doesn't exist, the reference is
misleading.

PROPOSAL: Verify the referenced doc exists before pointing to it.

================================================================================
POSITIVE OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

1. GOOD cleanup: Removing completed checklist items keeps the document focused
   on current/future work rather than accumulating historical cruft.

2. CLEAR status: "Looking for Next Spec" immediately communicates project state.

3. GOOD summary: The "Recently Completed" section provides appropriate high-level
   overview of what exec-15 delivered.

4. FORWARD-LOOKING: Identifying exec-16 as potential next work helps maintain
   project momentum.

5. CORRECT metadata: Database version (44) and tag (v1.0.0-alpha.124) are
   documented for reference.

================================================================================
VERDICT
================================================================================

This is appropriate housekeeping after completing a major feature. The document
transformation from "implementation tracker" to "status summary" is reasonable
once the work is done.

The main concern is loss of historical context, but this is a minor issue -
the git history preserves the detailed checklist, and the spec file in
specs/done/ likely contains similar information.

QUALITY: 8/10 - Clean refactor, minor information loss acceptable
RISK: None - Documentation only

================================================================================
ISSUE REVIEW
================================================================================
- Issue #1 (Historical context lost) - skipped (low severity, git history preserves it)
- Issue #2 (Backward Compatibility Notes removed) - skipped (low severity, doc-only)
- Issue #3 (exec-16 spec location) - skipped (very low severity, doc reference)
