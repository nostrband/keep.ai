TITLE: fix: Correct indentation in openrouter-proxy streaming handler
DATE: 2026-01-22

== CHANGES ==

This commit fixes a code formatting/indentation issue in openrouter-proxy.ts:

1. **Indentation fix:**
   - Lines 126-177 were indented with 4 spaces instead of 6 spaces
   - This made the streaming data handler code block appear to be at the wrong scope level
   - The code was inside `proxyReq.on('response')` callback but visually looked misaligned
   - Fixed to use proper 6-space indentation matching the surrounding code

2. **Whitespace standardization:**
   - Standardized blank lines within the callback for consistency
   - Some blank lines were inconsistent between code blocks

3. **Documentation:**
   - Added section to IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md documenting the fix

== ISSUES ==

### ISSUE 1: Purely cosmetic change with no functional impact
**Severity: None (informational)**

This is a formatting-only commit. JavaScript/TypeScript is indentation-agnostic, so the code behavior is unchanged. The diff appears large because an entire code block was re-indented.

The commit is appropriate for maintaining code quality and readability. The inconsistent indentation likely occurred due to copy-paste or editor misconfiguration in a previous commit.

== PROPOSALS ==

### PROPOSAL 1: Consider automated formatting
If indentation issues occur frequently, consider:
- Adding a `.editorconfig` file to enforce consistent indentation
- Running Prettier on save or as a pre-commit hook
- Adding ESLint with indentation rules

This would prevent similar formatting inconsistencies in the future.

### PROPOSAL 2: None needed for this specific fix
The commit is clean and does exactly what it claims. No changes required.

== SUMMARY ==

Clean formatting fix. The indentation issue was genuinely confusing when reading the code - it looked like the streaming data handler was outside the response callback when it wasn't. Good catch and appropriate fix.
