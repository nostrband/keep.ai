================================================================================
CHANGES SUMMARY
================================================================================

This commit adds user onboarding improvements to the main page:
1. Example automation suggestions that users can click to populate the input
2. A "Press Enter to create automation" hint when typing
3. Visual polish with a Sparkles icon
4. Improved empty state messaging for the "attention only" filter view

FILES MODIFIED:
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (20 changes - documentation updates)
- apps/web/src/components/MainPage.tsx (49 changes)

================================================================================
DETAILED CHANGES
================================================================================

NEW IMPORTS ADDED:
- Suggestions, Suggestion from "../ui" (UI components for clickable suggestions)
- Sparkles from "lucide-react" (icon for visual polish)

NEW CONSTANT:
```typescript
const EXAMPLE_SUGGESTIONS = [
  "Send me a daily summary of my unread emails",
  "Alert me when a website changes",
  "Remind me to drink water every 2 hours",
  "Save interesting tweets to a note",
];
```

EMPTY STATE UI CHANGES:
- Added conditional rendering based on showAttentionOnly filter
- For "attention only" filter: Shows "No workflows need attention" / "All automations are running smoothly"
- For default view: Shows Sparkles icon, "No automations yet", example suggestions grid
- Each suggestion is a clickable button that populates the input via setInput(suggestion)

PRESS ENTER HINT:
- Shows below the input when user has typed something
- Uses <kbd> element styled with Tailwind utilities
- Condition: input.trim() && !uploadState.isUploading

POTENTIAL ISSUES
================================================================================

ISSUE #1: Suggestions Container Not Using Suggestions Component
---------------------------------------------------------------
Severity: Low (Consistency)
Location: apps/web/src/components/MainPage.tsx lines ~385-390

The code imports both `Suggestions` (plural, a container component) and `Suggestion`
(individual items), but only uses the individual `Suggestion` components wrapped
in a manual div:

```typescript
<div className="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-2 max-w-lg">
  {EXAMPLE_SUGGESTIONS.map((suggestion, index) => (
    <Suggestion key={index} ... />
  ))}
</div>
```

The `Suggestions` component exists in the UI library and provides a horizontally
scrollable container with ScrollArea. The manual div uses `flex-wrap` instead
which is different behavior.

Analysis:
- Current implementation: flex-wrap causes items to wrap to multiple rows
- Suggestions component: horizontal scrolling, no wrap

The current flex-wrap behavior may actually be better for this use case (showing
all options at once), so this is not necessarily wrong, just inconsistent with
importing the unused Suggestions component.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE #2: Missing Accessibility Attributes
------------------------------------------
Severity: Medium
Location: apps/web/src/components/MainPage.tsx lines ~368-395

The empty state lacks proper accessibility markup:

1. No semantic headings - "No automations yet" is styled text, not an <h2> or <h3>
2. No aria-labels on suggestion buttons - screen readers will just say "button"
3. No semantic grouping for suggestions - no fieldset/legend or list structure
4. Sparkles icon has no aria-hidden attribute

For a v1 product aiming to be "lovable and complete", accessibility matters.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE #3: kbd Element Dark Mode Styling
---------------------------------------
Severity: Low
Location: apps/web/src/components/MainPage.tsx line ~502

The <kbd> element uses hardcoded light theme colors:
```html
<kbd className="px-1.5 py-0.5 bg-gray-100 rounded border border-gray-200 font-mono">
```

If the app supports dark mode (checking globals.css suggests it does with CSS
variables), this kbd styling would look wrong:
- bg-gray-100 stays light gray
- border-gray-200 stays light gray
- Would have poor contrast on dark backgrounds

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE #4: Using Array Index as React Key
----------------------------------------
Severity: Very Low
Location: apps/web/src/components/MainPage.tsx line ~386

```typescript
{EXAMPLE_SUGGESTIONS.map((suggestion, index) => (
  <Suggestion key={index} ...
```

Using array index as key is a React anti-pattern because:
- If items can be reordered/filtered, React may mismatch state
- Can cause performance issues with reconciliation

However, for this specific case:
- EXAMPLE_SUGGESTIONS is a static array that never changes
- Items are not reorderable or removable
- This is effectively safe, just not best practice

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE #5: Hardcoded Suggestion Text (i18n Concern)
--------------------------------------------------
Severity: Low (Future-proofing)
Location: apps/web/src/components/MainPage.tsx lines ~54-59

```typescript
const EXAMPLE_SUGGESTIONS = [
  "Send me a daily summary of my unread emails",
  "Alert me when a website changes",
  "Remind me to drink water every 2 hours",
  "Save interesting tweets to a note",
];
```

All strings are hardcoded in English. If the product ever needs internationalization,
this would need to be refactored to use i18n keys.

For a local personal automation product, this may not be a priority, but worth
noting for future scope.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE #6: Press Enter Hint Shows During Upload
----------------------------------------------
Severity: Very Low (Good catch by author)
Location: apps/web/src/components/MainPage.tsx line ~498

The condition `!uploadState.isUploading` correctly hides the "Press Enter" hint
during file uploads, which is good UX. No issue here - just noting good practice.

================================================================================
PROPOSALS
================================================================================

PROPOSAL #1: Add Basic Accessibility Attributes
-----------------------------------------------
Priority: Medium
Location: apps/web/src/components/MainPage.tsx

Improve accessibility with minimal changes:

```typescript
<div className="flex flex-col items-center justify-center py-12 text-center">
  <Sparkles className="size-12 text-gray-300 mb-4" aria-hidden="true" />
  <p className="text-gray-500 text-lg mb-2" role="heading" aria-level={2}>
    No automations yet
  </p>
  <p className="text-gray-400 text-sm mb-6">
    Type below or try one of these examples
  </p>
  <div
    className="flex flex-wrap justify-center gap-2 max-w-lg"
    role="group"
    aria-label="Example automation suggestions"
  >
    {EXAMPLE_SUGGESTIONS.map((suggestion, index) => (
      <Suggestion
        key={suggestion}  // Use suggestion text as key (unique)
        suggestion={suggestion}
        onClick={() => setInput(suggestion)}
        className="text-xs"
        aria-label={`Try: ${suggestion}`}
      />
    ))}
  </div>
</div>
```

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROPOSAL #2: Fix kbd Dark Mode Styling
--------------------------------------
Priority: Low
Location: apps/web/src/components/MainPage.tsx

Replace hardcoded colors with theme-aware variants:

```typescript
<kbd className="px-1.5 py-0.5 bg-muted rounded border border-border font-mono text-muted-foreground">
  Enter
</kbd>
```

Or use CSS variables that respect the theme:
- bg-muted (typically lighter than background)
- border-border (theme border color)
- text-muted-foreground (for subtle text)

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROPOSAL #3: Remove Unused Suggestions Import
---------------------------------------------
Priority: Very Low
Location: apps/web/src/components/MainPage.tsx line 23

If the Suggestions (plural) component is not being used, remove the import:

```typescript
// Change this:
import { Suggestion, Suggestions, ... } from "../ui";

// To this:
import { Suggestion, ... } from "../ui";
```

Keeps imports clean and makes it clear what's actually being used.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PROPOSAL #4: Use Suggestion Text as React Key
---------------------------------------------
Priority: Very Low
Location: apps/web/src/components/MainPage.tsx line 386

```typescript
// Change:
key={index}

// To:
key={suggestion}
```

Since each suggestion string is unique, this provides a stable key without relying
on array position. Marginal improvement but follows React best practices.

================================================================================
OVERALL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Risk Level: LOW
Impact: UX improvement - adds helpful onboarding guidance

This commit makes valuable UX improvements for new users:
- Example suggestions help users understand what the product can do
- Press Enter hint reduces friction for first-time use
- Sparkles icon adds appropriate visual polish

The implementation is solid with some minor areas for improvement:
- Accessibility could be enhanced with semantic markup and ARIA attributes
- Dark mode support for kbd element should be verified
- Unused Suggestions import could be cleaned up

VERDICT: Good commit. Achieves its UX goals effectively. The accessibility
improvements are the most actionable follow-up items for a "lovable and complete"
v1 release.
