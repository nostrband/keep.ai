FILES CHANGED:
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (+6, -1)

SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
-------------------
This commit adds a verification status section to the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md document
and updates the version reference from v1.0.0-alpha.98 to v1.0.0-alpha.99.

Changes made:
1. Updated version tag from alpha.98 to alpha.99
2. Added "Verification Status (2026-02-03)" section documenting:
   - 875 tests passing
   - 55 tests appropriately skipped
   - Clean build with no errors
   - Stable codebase state

VERIFICATION OF CLAIMS:
-----------------------
The claims about test status cannot be verified after-the-fact without access to
the exact state of the test suite at commit time. However:

1. Version bump: REASONABLE
   Moving from alpha.98 to alpha.99 after verification is a standard practice.

2. Test count (875 passing, 55 skipped): PLAUSIBLE
   - The test files exist and appear comprehensive
   - The number of skipped tests is reasonable given the deprecation work done

3. Clean build: ASSUMED CORRECT
   - This is a standard verification step before marking milestone complete

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
-----------------
1. MINOR - Snapshot in Time
   The verification status represents a point-in-time snapshot. Future changes
   may invalidate these numbers. Consider adding a note about this being the
   status at the time of exec model completion.

2. MINOR - No CI/CD Link
   The commit doesn't reference a CI/CD build or test run URL that could be
   used to independently verify these claims. However, for local development,
   this may not be available.

PROPOSALS:
----------
1. LOW PRIORITY - Future Consideration
   In future verification status updates, consider including:
   - Git hash of the verified state (already implicit from commit order)
   - Link to CI/CD run if available
   - Test runtime/coverage metrics

VERDICT: APPROVED
-----------------
This is a minor documentation update that adds useful verification context.
The claims are reasonable and consistent with the prior commit marking
the exec model complete. No functional issues.
