COMMIT: 1c2ae8a
TITLE: chore: Reorganize specs - move completed to done/, active to root
DATE: Fri Jan 23 13:44:04 2026 +0100

=== SUMMARY ===

This commit reorganizes the specs directory structure:

1. Moves 13 completed v1.0 SLC specs FROM specs/ TO specs/done/:
   - 00-v1-slc-refactor-overview.md through 12-chat-events-split.md

2. Moves 19 active specs FROM specs/new/ TO specs/ (root):
   - 01-chat-page-autonomy-toggle.md through 11-server-error-header-notice.md
   - consolidate-auth-config-hooks.md, deprecate-auth-dialog.md, and others

The reorganization follows a clear pattern:
- specs/done/ = completed specifications
- specs/ (root) = active/in-progress specifications
- specs/new/ = newly added specifications awaiting promotion

Note: Subsequent commits (e.g., 954f6b2) moved the 19 specs to specs/done/ after
they were implemented, which is the correct lifecycle.

=== ANALYSIS ===

File operations:
- All moves are R100 (100% identical) rename operations
- No content modifications made to any spec files
- Clean directory reorganization

Current state verification:
- specs/ root: 8 specs (connectors framework specs - active work)
- specs/done/: 197 specs (all completed)
- specs/new/: 1 spec (audit-workflow-timestamp-updates.md)

The directory structure follows a logical pattern:
- Numbered specs (00-12) from v1.0 SLC release are in done/
- Connectors specs (priority 1) are currently active in root
- New/upcoming specs can be in new/ before promotion

=== ISSUES ===

1. MINOR - Broken relative link in documentation
   Location: ideas/detect-abandoned-drafts.md
   Line contains: `../specs/00-main-screen.md`
   Should be: `../specs/done/00-main-screen.md`

   Impact: Documentation only, not code-breaking. The ideas/ folder contains
   brainstorming documents, not production code.

=== PROPOSALS ===

1. For issue #1 (broken link):
   Fix the relative link in ideas/detect-abandoned-drafts.md:
   ```markdown
   - [Spec 00: Main Screen](../specs/done/00-main-screen.md) - Where abandoned draft indicators would appear
   ```

   This is a trivial fix and can be done in a cleanup commit.

=== VERDICT ===

APPROVED - Clean directory reorganization with no code impact. The commit
correctly moves specs to their appropriate locations. One minor documentation
link is broken but has no functional impact. The subsequent movement of the
19 specs to specs/done/ (in later commits) confirms the proper lifecycle
of specs: new/ -> root -> done/.
