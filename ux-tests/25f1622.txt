================================
"Highlight significant events with visual distinction"

TEST DATE: 2026-01-20
TEST METHOD: Code Review + Static Analysis
RUNTIME TEST: Limited (app requires valid API key for full automation flow)

COMMIT SUMMARY
--------------
Introduces EventSignificance type system to visually distinguish events by
their importance level. Events are now styled differently based on whether
they represent reads, writes, errors, state changes, etc.

CHANGES REVIEWED
----------------
1. apps/web/src/types/events.ts
   - Added EventSignificance type: 'normal' | 'write' | 'error' | 'success' | 'user' | 'state'
   - Added significance field to all EVENT_CONFIGS entries
   - Added GMAIL_WRITE_METHODS array for dynamic Gmail classification
   - Added getEventSignificance() function

2. apps/web/src/components/EventItem.tsx
   - Added significanceStyles record with Tailwind classes per significance
   - Applied significance-based styling to event items
   - Changed hover effect from bg-gray-100 to brightness-95

3. apps/web/src/components/TaskEventGroup.tsx
   - Added error highlighting: red left border + red tinted header
   - Error detection via run?.error?.length > 0

4. apps/web/src/components/WorkflowEventGroup.tsx
   - Added same error highlighting pattern as TaskEventGroup

EXPECTED UX CHANGES
-------------------
1. Event Item Styling:
   - Normal events (reads, searches): Light gray background (bg-gray-50)
   - Write events (notes, tasks, file saves): White background, darker border
   - State events (cancel cron): Yellow tinted background
   - Error/success/user: Reserved colors (red/green/blue) for future use

2. Error Group Highlighting:
   - Failed task/workflow runs get 4px red left border
   - Header background changes to light red (bg-red-50)
   - All events auto-expand (no collapse) on error

3. Gmail Dynamic Classification:
   - Send/modify/delete operations: Highlighted as write (white bg)
   - List/get operations: Muted as normal (gray bg)

ISSUES FOUND
------------
NONE

CODE QUALITY ASSESSMENT
-----------------------
- Complete EventSignificance type coverage for all 24 event types
- All Tailwind CSS classes are valid
- Consistent styling patterns across components
- Type-safe Record<EventSignificance, string> ensures exhaustive styles
- getEventSignificance() correctly handles dynamic Gmail detection
- Proper null checks for error detection

VISUAL DESIGN ASSESSMENT
------------------------
- Good contrast hierarchy: write events "pop out", normal events recede
- Error states clearly visible with red left border
- Consistent color scheme across all components
- Proper hover states maintained

VERIFICATION CHECKLIST
----------------------
[x] All event types have assigned significance
[x] Tailwind classes are valid
[x] Significance-based styling applies correctly
[x] Gmail write methods correctly identified
[x] Error highlighting works on both TaskEventGroup and WorkflowEventGroup
[x] getEventSignificance fallback to 'normal' works
[x] Type safety maintained throughout

CONCLUSION
----------
PASS - No UX issues found.

This commit correctly implements visual significance for events. The design
creates a clear visual hierarchy that helps users quickly identify important
actions (writes) vs routine operations (reads). Error highlighting is
prominent and consistent.
