Title: docs: Move verified complete specs to specs/done
Date: Fri Jan 23 17:21:41 2026 +0100

## Summary

This commit moves 6 specification files from `specs/new/` to `specs/done/` after verifying that all features described in those specs were already implemented in the codebase. The commit is purely organizational - file renames with no content changes.

Specs moved:
1. align-test-schemas-with-production.md - Test schemas with NOT NULL constraints
2. extract-message-parsing-utility.md - parseMessageContent() utility
3. optimize-has-script-subquery.md - COUNT(DISTINCT s.id) optimization
4. test-abandoned-drafts-boundaries.md - Boundary tests for abandoned drafts
5. test-boolean-integer-conversion.md - Boolean/integer conversion tests
6. test-console-log-special-chars.md - Special character tests for console.log

## Verification Results

All 6 claims were verified by searching the codebase:

1. **Test schemas with NOT NULL constraints** - VERIFIED
   - packages/tests/src/script-store.test.ts contains createScriptTables() helper
   - All tables (scripts, script_runs, workflows, tasks, chat_messages) have NOT NULL constraints

2. **parseMessageContent() utility** - VERIFIED
   - apps/cli/src/commands/chat.ts:24-39 contains the function
   - Handles JSON parsing with fallback for non-JSON messages

3. **COUNT(DISTINCT s.id) optimization** - VERIFIED
   - packages/db/src/script-store.ts:868 uses this pattern in getAbandonedDrafts()
   - Avoids counting duplicate rows when checking for script existence

4. **Abandoned draft boundary tests** - VERIFIED
   - packages/tests/src/script-store.test.ts:886-947 contains boundary tests
   - Tests exact 7-day threshold with +1 second (included) and -1 hour (excluded)

5. **Boolean conversion tests** - VERIFIED
   - packages/tests/src/script-store.test.ts:644-755 contains 11 tests
   - Covers round-trip, integer interpretation, default values, persistence methods

6. **Special character tests** - VERIFIED
   - packages/tests/src/utility-tools.test.ts:210-394 contains 11 tests
   - Covers quotes, newlines, tabs, unicode, emojis, backslashes, null chars, etc.

## Issues

None identified. This is a straightforward documentation/organization commit that accurately reflects the state of the codebase.

## Proposals

None needed.
