COMMIT: 64bd82f - Remove done specs
AUTHOR: Artur Briugeman <brugeman.artur@gmail.com>

=== CHANGES SUMMARY ===

This commit moves 8 connector-related specification files from `specs/` to `specs/done/`. This is a housekeeping commit to organize completed specification documents related to the connectors feature.

Files moved (all are renames with no content changes):
- connectors-00-build-secrets.md
- connectors-01-core-package.md
- connectors-02-connection-manager.md
- connectors-03-gmail-refactor.md
- connectors-04-server-endpoints.md
- connectors-05-ui-connections-page.md
- connectors-06-google-services.md
- connectors-07-notion.md

NOTE: The commit message says "Remove done specs" but it's actually moving them to `specs/done/`, not deleting them. The message is slightly misleading.

=== POTENTIAL ISSUES ===

1. MISLEADING COMMIT MESSAGE (Trivial)
   - The commit message "Remove done specs" implies deletion
   - Actually the files are moved to `specs/done/`
   - A more accurate message would be "Move done specs" or "Archive connector specs to done/"

   SEVERITY: Trivial. The files are preserved, just the commit message could cause confusion when reading git history.

=== PROPOSALS ===

None required. This is a simple organizational commit. The misleading commit message is too minor to warrant any action.

=== VERDICT ===

CLEAN - No code issues. The commit properly archives completed connector specifications. The commit message could be clearer but this is trivial.
