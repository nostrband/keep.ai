## Collapse low-signal events

### Goal

Reduce visual noise in run logs by auto-collapsing routine events.

### Status

**Placeholder - to be explored later**

### Options to consider

* Auto-collapse simple reads (Gmail fetch, file reads)
* Only show errors + write actions by default
* "Show all" toggle to expand everything
* Collapse by event type (all Gmail reads grouped)
* Smart collapsing based on event count (collapse if > 5 similar events)
