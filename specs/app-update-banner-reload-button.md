# Spec: Add Reload button to app update banner

## Problem

The AppUpdateBanner notifies users that the app has been updated, but doesn't provide an action to activate the new version. Users may not realize they need to reload the page to use the updated app.

## Solution

Add a "Reload" button to the update banner that reloads the page when clicked.

## Expected Outcome

- Update banner displays a Reload button alongside the dismiss button
- Clicking Reload refreshes the page to activate the new version
- Button styling is consistent with the existing banner design
