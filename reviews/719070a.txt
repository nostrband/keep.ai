Date: 2026-01-22 14:37:37 +0100
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
------------------
This commit updates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md to mark Spec 10 (Tasks Table Cleanup) as
COMPLETED. The changes include:

1. Updated "Last Updated" timestamp to reflect Spec 10 completion
2. Summary section: Moved Spec 10 from "NOT STARTED" to "COMPLETED" in P0 specs group
3. Infrastructure Gaps: Marked "v30 pending for Spec 10" as DONE
4. Status table: Changed Spec 10 status from "NOT STARTED" to "COMPLETED" with details
   "v30 migration, task.asks, useTaskState deprecated"
5. Spec 10 section: Added comprehensive completion notes documenting all changes made:
   - Created migration v30 with workflow_id and asks columns
   - Added getTaskByWorkflowId() and updateTaskAsks() methods
   - Marked TaskState interface as deprecated
   - Updated agent-env.ts, ask.ts, finish.ts tools
   - Updated task-worker.ts, ChatPage.tsx, TaskDetailPage.tsx, TaskRunDetailPage.tsx
   - Marked useTaskState hook as deprecated
   - Updated add-task.ts, add-task-recurring.ts, get-task.ts, list-tasks.ts tools
6. Updated checklist: Changed Spec 10 from unchecked to checked with new migration version

ANALYSIS
--------
This is a documentation-only commit that accurately records the completion of a major
spec. The completion notes are thorough and provide a good audit trail of all the
changes that were made as part of Spec 10.

POTENTIAL ISSUES
----------------

1. MINOR: Migration version inconsistency in action items
   - The "Action Items" section still references "migration v28" (line ~339 in original)
   - But completion notes and status correctly say "v30"
   - This is a copy-paste artifact from the original spec that wasn't updated
   - Impact: Could confuse future readers
   - Resolution: Update the action items template to say v30, or add a note that
     the action items show the original plan while completion notes show actual
     implementation

2. MINOR: Redundant "Original Verified Current State" section
   - After marking as COMPLETED, the document keeps the original verified state
     which describes "Task interface missing workflow_id and asks fields"
   - This is now historical/stale information
   - Impact: Low - it's labeled as "Original" but could be cleaner
   - Resolution: Consider moving to a collapsed/archived section or adding strikethrough

3. OBSERVATION: Good documentation practice
   - The completion notes provide a clear record of what was actually implemented
   - This is helpful for code archaeology and understanding the evolution

PROPOSALS
---------
None required - this is a low-risk documentation update. The minor inconsistencies
noted above are cosmetic and don't affect functionality.

VERDICT: ACCEPTABLE
The documentation accurately reflects the completion of Spec 10 with comprehensive
notes. Minor cleanup could improve clarity but is not required.
