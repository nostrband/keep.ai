# Spec: Fix Connection String Regex in Test

## Problem

The regex in nostr-transport.test.ts that validates connection strings is overly permissive and doesn't match the actual code behavior:
- Marks nonce as optional when it's always generated and required
- Includes exp parameter that is never generated

The test passes but doesn't accurately validate the connection string format.

## Solution

Update the regex to correctly require the nonce parameter and remove the unused exp parameter option.

## Expected Outcome

- Test regex accurately reflects the connection string format generated by the code
- Test would fail if the connection string format unexpectedly changes
- Better test coverage of the actual connection string contract

## Considerations

- Verify the exact nonce format/length used in production
