COMMIT: d535307 - Drop old plan
DATE: Thu Jan 22 11:27:35 2026 +0100
FILES CHANGED: 1 file (+0 -1,418)

================================================================================
SUMMARY OF CHANGES
================================================================================

This commit deletes the entire IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md file (1,418 lines).

The deleted file contained:
- P0 Critical items (7 issues) - All marked FIXED with detailed resolution notes
- P1 High Priority items (multiple issues) - Mix of fixed and pending
- P2 Medium Priority items (numerous specs and issues)
- Detailed tracking of implementation status, complexity estimates, file paths
- Root cause analysis and fix descriptions for each item

This deletion follows commit d296440 which introduced a new documentation and
spec-driven workflow. The old monolithic plan is replaced by:
- Distributed spec files in specs/new/*.md
- Review files tracking code changes
- Idea documents for future work

================================================================================
POTENTIAL ISSUES
================================================================================

ISSUE 1: Loss of historical context and fix documentation
Severity: Medium (Documentation)
Location: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (deleted)

The deleted file contained valuable information:
- Detailed root cause analysis for P0 bugs
- Exact line numbers where issues occurred
- Resolution notes describing what was changed and why
- Complexity estimates that were validated through implementation

This information is now lost and cannot be easily reconstructed.

PROPOSAL: Before deleting, the historical information could have been:
- Archived to docs/history/implementation-plan-v1.md
- Extracted into post-mortems for significant bugs
- Summarized in a "lessons learned" document

Going forward, consider keeping resolved plans in an archive directory rather
than deleting them entirely.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE 2: No migration of pending items to new spec system
Severity: Low (Completeness)
Location: N/A

The plan contained pending P1/P2 items that may not all have corresponding
specs in the new specs/new/*.md directory. Some tracking information may be
lost.

PROPOSAL: Before deletion, pending items should have been verified to have
corresponding specs, or explicitly marked as deprioritized/cancelled.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ISSUE 3: Deletion timing relative to new system readiness
Severity: Low (Process)
Location: N/A

The deletion occurs just 2 minutes after commit d296440 (11:25 vs 11:27).
This tight timing suggests the deletion may have been hasty, without full
verification that all useful information was preserved.

PROPOSAL: For future major process transitions, allow a buffer period where
both old and new systems coexist, enabling validation that nothing is lost.

================================================================================
ARCHITECTURAL OBSERVATIONS
================================================================================

This commit represents the final step in transitioning from:

OLD SYSTEM (IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md):
- Single monolithic document
- Manual status tracking
- Centralized priority management
- Direct fix documentation inline

NEW SYSTEM (specs/new/*.md + reviews/*.txt):
- Distributed spec files
- Automated review tracking
- Decentralized issue identification
- Specs describe "what" not "how"

BENEFITS OF NEW APPROACH:
- Scales better with codebase growth
- Supports AI-assisted code review workflow
- Creates audit trail via review files
- Separates specification from implementation details

RISKS:
- Historical knowledge may be harder to find
- No single place to see overall project status
- Relies on consistent spec creation process

RECOMMENDATIONS:

1. Create an archive policy for deleted planning documents
2. Consider a summary dashboard that aggregates spec status
3. Establish clear criteria for when old documents can be deleted
4. Document the transition in a "process changelog" for future reference

ISSUE REVIEW
================================================================================
- All issues - skipped (medium severity, not v1 blocker)
