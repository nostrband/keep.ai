COMMIT: 787d1cfa288655f8a1dcc1bd56c481b39352a990

SUBJECT: Remove 'ideas' from plan prompt

================================================================================
CHANGES SUMMARY
================================================================================

This commit modifies PROMPT_plan.md to:

1. Removes the instruction to check `ideas/*` folder when adding specs
2. Removes the instruction to author specifications at `specs/FILENAME.md`
3. Removes the instruction to document plans in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent
4. Simplifies the ULTIMATE GOAL statement to be more concise
5. Renames the product from generic "local personal automation product" to "Keep.AI"

Before:
> ULTIMATE GOAL: We want to achieve a simple, lovable and complete v1 release of
> a local personal automation product with AI creating and maintaining the
> automations. Consider missing elements and plan accordingly. If an element is
> missing, search first to confirm it doesn't exist, then if needed author the
> specification at specs/FILENAME.md, also check `ideas/*` for ideas to consider
> when adding specs. If you create a new element then document the plan to
> implement it in @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md using a subagent.

After:
> ULTIMATE GOAL: We want to achieve a simple, lovable and complete v1 Keep.AI
> release - it's a local personal automation product with AI creating and
> maintaining the automations, with user only expressing intent and then fully
> delegating to the system.

POTENTIAL ISSUES
================================================================================

1. MISSING NEWLINE AT END OF FILE
   Severity: Minor (styling)

   The new file content ends without a trailing newline, which is a common
   convention violation. Most style guides and tools expect files to end with
   a newline character.

2. LOSS OF SPEC AUTHORING GUIDANCE
   Severity: Low-Medium (potential process gap)

   The previous prompt explicitly instructed agents to:
   - Search before assuming something is missing
   - Author specs at specs/FILENAME.md if needed
   - Check ideas/* for context when adding specs
   - Document plans in IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

   This guidance is now removed. The simplified goal statement focuses on the
   product vision but loses the operational instructions for how to handle
   missing functionality.

   Question: Is this guidance now provided elsewhere? Looking at the current
   PROMPT_plan.md, step 1 does mention creating/updating @IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md,
   so that specific guidance wasn't fully lost - it's covered in step 1.

3. IDEAS FOLDER STILL EXISTS
   Severity: Informational

   The `ideas/` folder still exists with 15 files. This commit removes the
   instruction to reference it, but the folder itself remains. This may be
   intentional (ideas are now archived/deprecated) or an oversight.

================================================================================
PROPOSALS
================================================================================

1. ADD TRAILING NEWLINE
   Add a newline at the end of the file to follow standard conventions.

   Effort: Trivial

2. CLARIFY IDEAS FOLDER STATUS
   Either:
   a) Move `ideas/` to `ideas_archived/` or add a README indicating these are
      historical ideas that have been superseded
   b) Delete the `ideas/` folder if no longer needed
   c) Keep as-is if the ideas are still valuable reference material even though
      agents aren't explicitly directed to check them

   Effort: Trivial

================================================================================
OVERALL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

This is a reasonable simplification of the planning prompt. The key changes:
- Product now has a name (Keep.AI) in the prompt
- Vision statement is cleaner and emphasizes user delegation
- Removes potentially outdated process instructions

The commit appears intentional and appropriate for a maturing project that no
longer needs agents to create new specs from scratch (v1 scope is likely frozen).

No bugs or critical issues identified.

ISSUE REVIEW
================================================================================
- No actionable issues (low severity or informational only)
