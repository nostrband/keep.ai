SUMMARY OF CHANGES
------------------
This commit removes debug console.log statements from 6 files in the web app:

1. apps/web/src/QueryProviderEmbedded.tsx
   - Removed "Service worker controller change" log from handleControllerChange()

2. apps/web/src/components/FilesPage.tsx
   - Removed file upload success log after nostr upload

3. apps/web/src/components/NewPage.tsx
   - Removed 'Creating task...' log before api.createTask call

4. apps/web/src/hooks/dbChatReads.ts
   - Removed 'Invalidate' log when invalidating chat queries

5. apps/web/src/hooks/useFileUpload.ts
   - Removed file upload success log with fileRecord details

6. apps/web/src/queryClient.ts
   - Removed notifyTablesChanged debug log showing tables, isLocalChange, globalThis
   - Changed error handler from console.log("error", e) to console.error("onTablesUpdate error:", e)

Total: 10 lines removed, 1 line modified

ANALYSIS
--------
This is a straightforward cleanup commit that removes debug logging that was likely
added during development. The changes are appropriate for production readiness.

The error handling change in queryClient.ts deserves specific attention:
- BEFORE: .catch((e: any) => console.log("error", e))
- AFTER:  .catch((e: any) => console.error("onTablesUpdate error:", e))

This change is CORRECT because:
- console.error() properly indicates error-level severity
- The new message "onTablesUpdate error:" provides better context than generic "error"
- Errors are more visible in browser dev tools and monitoring systems
- The catch block still prevents crashes - just improves logging quality

ISSUES FOUND
------------
No significant issues found.

MINOR OBSERVATIONS
------------------
1. The commit is well-scoped - only touches debug logging, no functional changes.

2. The onTablesUpdate function (called in queryClient.ts) is only used in one place
   (dbChatReads.ts) where it does optimistic updates for chat events. The error
   handling is appropriate since failures in this path shouldn't crash the app
   but should be logged for debugging.

PROPOSALS
---------
None required - this is a clean, well-executed cleanup commit.

VERDICT: APPROVED
