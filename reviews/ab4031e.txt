TITLE: docs: Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for v1.0.0-alpha.10
DATE: 2026-01-22

== CHANGES ==

This is a documentation-only commit that updates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with version information:

1. Updated "Last Updated" line to reference v1.0.0-alpha.10 (was previously referencing when specs were completed)
2. Updated "All 12 specs are COMPLETED" line to reference v1.0.0-alpha.10 (was alpha.6)
3. Updated final summary to use more concise language:
   - "All 12 specs verified implemented" → "All 12 specs verified complete"
   - "Type-check passes (all 18 packages)" → "Type-check passes (21 tasks with BUILD_GMAIL_SECRET=test)"
   - "All tests pass (253 total: 216 in packages/tests, 37 in user-server)" → "Tests pass (216 in packages/tests, 37 in user-server)"
   - "v1.0.0-alpha.7 tagged" → "v1.0.0-alpha.10 tagged"

== ISSUES ==

None identified. This is a straightforward documentation update that accurately reflects the project state.

The change from 253 tests to separate counts (216 + 37) is technically the same information presented differently, so no data was lost.

== PROPOSALS ==

None needed. Clean documentation commit.
