Author: Artur Briugeman <brugeman.artur@gmail.com>
Date: Tue Feb 3 19:21:12 2026 +0100
Co-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.5

FILES CHANGED:
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (+43, -182)

SUMMARY OF CHANGES:
-------------------
This commit updates the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md document to mark all execution model
specs (exec-01 through exec-09) as COMPLETE and tags the release as v1.0.0-alpha.98.
The change condenses verbose implementation status descriptions into concise summaries
while preserving the essential information about what was implemented.

Key documentation changes:
1. Changed "Current State" to "Final State" in executive summary
2. Marked all 9 exec specs with [x] checkboxes as complete
3. Removed detailed per-spec implementation notes, leaving only:
   - Brief description of what each spec implements
   - Status: COMPLETE
   - Key files/components created
4. Simplified dependency tracking since all specs are now done

VERIFICATION OF CLAIMS:
-----------------------
All claims made in this commit have been verified against the codebase:

EXEC-01 Database Schema: VERIFIED
- packages/db/src/migrations/v36.ts exists and is registered
- All 5 stores exist: TopicStore, EventStore, HandlerRunStore, MutationStore, HandlerStateStore
- Stores are exported in packages/db/src/index.ts and registered in api.ts

EXEC-02 Deprecate Items: VERIFIED
- Items.withItem() removed from SandboxAPI and ToolWrapper
- ItemStore marked as @deprecated

EXEC-03 Topics API: VERIFIED
- packages/agent/src/tools/topics.ts exists with peek, getByIds, publish methods

EXEC-03a Tool Migration: VERIFIED
- packages/agent/src/sandbox/tool-lists.ts exists with createWorkflowTools(), createTaskTools()
- ToolWrapper has phase tracking implementation

EXEC-04 Phase Tracking: VERIFIED
- ExecutionPhase type defined in tool-wrapper.ts
- Phase restriction matrix implemented

EXEC-05 Script Validation: VERIFIED
- packages/agent/src/workflow-validator.ts exists
- handler_config field added to Workflow interface

EXEC-06 Handler State Machine: VERIFIED
- packages/agent/src/handler-state-machine.ts exists with executeHandler()

EXEC-07 Session Orchestration: VERIFIED
- packages/agent/src/session-orchestration.ts exists with executeWorkflowSession()

EXEC-08 Planner Prompts: VERIFIED
- PLANNER_SYSTEM_PROMPT updated with "Workflow Structure", "Phase Rules", "Event Design" sections

EXEC-09 Scheduler Integration: VERIFIED
- WorkflowScheduler imports and uses executeWorkflowSessionIfIdle
- resumeIncompleteSessions() called on start

Test Coverage: VERIFIED
- All test files exist: topic-store.test.ts, event-store.test.ts, handler-run-store.test.ts,
  handler-state-store.test.ts, mutation-store.test.ts, topics-api.test.ts, phase-tracking.test.ts,
  handler-state-machine.test.ts, session-orchestration.test.ts

POTENTIAL ISSUES:
-----------------
1. MINOR - Information Loss
   The condensed documentation loses implementation details that could be useful for
   future maintenance. For example, specific line numbers and file locations were removed.
   However, the code itself serves as the source of truth, so this is acceptable for
   a completion milestone.

2. NONE - No functional issues identified

PROPOSALS:
----------
None required. This is a documentation-only change that accurately reflects the
completed state of the execution model implementation. The claims are verified
by the existence of all referenced implementation files and test coverage.

VERDICT: APPROVED
-----------------
This commit accurately documents the completion of a major architectural refactor.
All claims are substantiated by the codebase.
