## Summary

This is a merge commit that integrates the remote `main` branch into the local `main` branch. It combines changes from two parent commits:
- 80fc4db (local): Remove 'draft' from scheduler
- f420654 (remote): Various changes from the remote repository

The merge itself does not introduce new code changes - all the individual changes were made in the parent commits which have been reviewed separately.

## Changes Merged

The merge brings in significant changes including:
- Implementation plan updates
- New execution model components (handler-state-machine, session-orchestration, workflow-validator)
- New database stores (event-store, handler-run-store, handler-state-store, mutation-store, topic-store)
- New migration files (v36, v37, v38)
- Topics API implementation
- Deprecated task tools removal
- Comprehensive test coverage for new components
- Multiple spec files moved to done folder
- Review files for previously reviewed commits

## Issues

None. This is a standard merge commit with no conflicts. All individual changes have been reviewed in their respective commits.

## Proposals

None needed. The merge was clean and all constituent commits have independent reviews.
