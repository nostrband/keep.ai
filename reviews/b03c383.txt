COMMIT REVIEW: b03c383
=======================
docs: Remove stale note from IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
------------------
This commit removes an outdated parenthetical note from the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
file. The change is a single line modification:

Before:
  - [x] **enterMaintenanceMode() method** - Logic error routing via enterMaintenanceMode()
        in `workflow-worker.ts` (NOTE: currently routes to planner inbox, not maintainer)

After:
  - [x] **enterMaintenanceMode() method** - Logic error routing via enterMaintenanceMode()
        in `workflow-worker.ts`

The note "(NOTE: currently routes to planner inbox, not maintainer)" was stale because
the implementation had already been fixed to properly route to the maintainer task type,
but the documentation hadn't been updated to reflect this.

CONTEXT
-------
The enterMaintenanceMode() function is a core mechanism for automatic script repair.
When logic errors occur in workflows, this function:
1. Increments maintenance_fix_count (tracking fix budget, max 3 attempts)
2. Sets maintenance = true flag on the workflow
3. Creates a maintainer task (type: "maintainer") with isolated thread
4. Routes the failing script_run to the maintainer for bounded repair

The stale note incorrectly suggested this routing still went to "planner inbox" when
it had already been updated to route to the maintainer.

POTENTIAL ISSUES
----------------
None identified.

This is a straightforward documentation cleanup. The change is correct - removing
stale information that would confuse readers about the current implementation state.

PROPOSALS
---------
No changes needed. The commit is clean and appropriate.

VERDICT: APPROVED
-----------------
Simple, correct documentation fix. No issues found.
