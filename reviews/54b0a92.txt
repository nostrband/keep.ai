# Review: 54b0a92 - Remove parseAsks re-export from @app/agent

## Summary

This commit removes unnecessary backward-compatibility re-exports of `parseAsks` and `StructuredAsk` from the `@app/agent` package. These utilities now live exclusively in `@app/proto`.

### Changes in Plain English

1. **Removed re-export from ask.ts** (`packages/agent/src/ai-tools/ask.ts`):
   - Deleted line: `export { parseAsks, type StructuredAsk } from "@app/proto";`
   - The ask tool file now only contains the tool definition itself

2. **Removed re-export from index.ts** (`packages/agent/src/index.ts`):
   - Deleted lines that re-exported `parseAsks` and `StructuredAsk` from the ask.ts file
   - These were marked as "Ask tool utilities for UI" but weren't being used from @app/agent

3. **Updated IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md**:
   - Marked spec as completed
   - Documented that no imports were using @app/agent for these utilities

4. **Moved spec to done folder**

## Issues Identified

### No Issues Found

This is a clean code cleanup commit with no problems.

**Verification performed by exploration agent**:
- Searched entire codebase for imports of `parseAsks` or `StructuredAsk` from `@app/agent`
- Found none - all imports already use `@app/proto` directly
- The only active import is in `apps/web/src/components/ChatPage.tsx:8` using `@app/proto`

## Code Quality Assessment

### Positive Aspects

1. **Safe removal**: Verified no consumers exist before removing
2. **Clean deletion**: No commented-out code or TODO markers left behind
3. **Single source of truth**: `@app/proto` is now the only place to import these from
4. **Package boundary improvement**: `@app/agent` is a heavy Node.js package; keeping lightweight types in `@app/proto` (which is browser-compatible) is the right architecture

### Why This Change is Good

- **Reduced confusion**: Developers won't be uncertain about which package to import from
- **Cleaner dependency graph**: UI code importing from `@app/proto` doesn't accidentally pull in agent dependencies
- **Maintenance**: One place to update the implementation

---

## Verdict

**APPROVED** - This is a clean code cleanup that improves package organization with zero risk.
