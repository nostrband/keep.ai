COMMIT REVIEW: d01a17d - Hide empty event dropdown menu
=======================================================

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
------------------
This commit conditionally renders the dropdown menu in EventItem only when hasNavigation is
true. When no actions are available, a spacer div with matching width (34px) is displayed
instead to maintain consistent layout alignment with other event items.

Previously, the dropdown button was always shown, but clicking it for non-navigable events
displayed a disabled "No actions available" menu item - poor UX.

Net result: +2 lines (minor restructuring). Eliminates misleading UI element.

POSITIVE ASPECTS
----------------
1. Correctly removes misleading dropdown button that only showed disabled items
2. Spacer maintains consistent visual alignment with other events that have menus
3. hasNavigation logic is sound: requires BOTH config.hasId AND config.getEntityPath
4. Good accessibility: no changes needed since spacer has no interactive elements
5. File properly ends with newline (contrary to what diff output suggested)

VERIFICATION OF IMPLEMENTATION
------------------------------

### hasNavigation determination (verified correct)
The hasNavigation variable is determined by: `config.hasId && config.getEntityPath`

Event type breakdown (26 total event types in EVENT_TYPE_CONFIGS):
- 7 event types have dropdown visible (hasId: true with getEntityPath defined):
  - CREATE_NOTE → /notes/{id}
  - UPDATE_NOTE → /notes/{id}
  - ADD_TASK → /tasks/{id}
  - ADD_TASK_CRON → /tasks/{id}
  - SEND_TO_TASK_INBOX → /tasks/{target_task_id}
  - TASK_UPDATE → /tasks/{task_id}
  - ADD_SCRIPT → /scripts/{script_id}
- 19 event types have dropdown hidden (spacer shown instead)

### Spacer width calculation (verified accurate)
Button classes: `ml-2 px-2 py-1`
Width calculation using Tailwind defaults (1rem = 16px):
- ml-2: 0.5rem = 8px
- px-2: 0.5rem × 2 = 16px padding
- Content `···`: ~10px
- Total: 8px + 16px + ~10px = 34px ✓

The spacer correctly replicates: `<div className="ml-2 px-2 py-1 flex-shrink-0 w-[34px]" />`

### Consistency with other components (acceptable)
WorkflowEventGroup and TaskEventGroup always show their dropdowns (no conditional rendering).
This is reasonable because:
- Those components always have actions available ("Retry", "View workflow/task")
- EventItem has varying action availability depending on event type
- EventItem is the only component needing this pattern

ISSUES IDENTIFIED
-----------------
None. This is a clean, well-implemented UX improvement.

EDGE CASES VERIFIED
-------------------
- All 7 event types with hasId: true have getEntityPath defined (no false positives)
- Zero event types with hasId: false have getEntityPath (no false negatives)
- Special case DELETE_NOTE correctly has hasId: false with comment "Can't navigate to deleted note"
- Cursor and hover styles only apply when hasNavigation is true (line 62)

ACCESSIBILITY VERIFICATION
--------------------------
- Dropdown button has aria-label="Event actions" when visible
- Spacer div has no interactive elements, no aria-label needed
- Events without navigation don't have misleading cursor-pointer styles
- Screen readers won't see any misleading interactive elements

CONCLUSION
----------
This is an excellent, focused improvement. The implementation is correct, the spacer width
accurately matches the button width, and no issues or edge cases were found. The change
successfully improves UX by eliminating a misleading UI element while maintaining visual
consistency through proper spacing.
