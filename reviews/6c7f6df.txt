SUBJECT: Remove 'specs/new' from plan prompt

================================================================================
CHANGES SUMMARY
================================================================================

This commit modifies PROMPT_plan.md to add `specs/new/*` to the ignore list when
studying specifications.

Before:
> 0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the
> application specifications. Ignore implemented specs in `specs/done/*`.

After:
> 0a. Study `specs/*` with up to 250 parallel Sonnet subagents to learn the
> application specifications. Ignore implemented specs in `specs/done/*` and
> in `specs/new/*`.

The change instructs planning agents to ignore both:
- `specs/done/*` - already implemented specs
- `specs/new/*` - apparently new/draft specs that shouldn't be studied yet

================================================================================
POTENTIAL ISSUES
================================================================================

1. UNCLEAR SEMANTICS OF specs/new/*
   Severity: Low (documentation gap)

   The commit adds `specs/new/*` to the ignore list but doesn't explain what
   this directory represents. Currently `specs/new/` exists but is empty.

   Possible interpretations:
   a) Work-in-progress specs not yet ready for implementation
   b) Specs for future versions beyond v1
   c) Placeholder for a different workflow

   Without documentation, future developers/agents may not understand why this
   directory should be ignored or what should go there.

2. COMMIT MESSAGE SLIGHTLY MISLEADING
   Severity: Trivial

   The commit message says "Remove 'specs/new' from plan prompt" but technically
   it's adding specs/new/* to the IGNORE list, not removing a reference to it.
   The net effect is that specs/new is now excluded from consideration.

================================================================================
PROPOSALS
================================================================================

1. ADD README TO specs/new/
   Create a brief README.md in `specs/new/` explaining what this directory is
   for and why specs there should not be studied by planning agents.

   Example content:
   ```
   # New/Draft Specifications

   This directory contains work-in-progress specifications that are not yet
   ready for implementation. Planning agents should ignore this directory.

   Specs move to `specs/` when ready for implementation.
   Specs move to `specs/done/` when fully implemented.
   ```

   Effort: Trivial

================================================================================
OVERALL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

This is a simple, low-risk change that extends the ignore pattern for the
planning agent. The change is consistent with the previous commit (787d1cf)
which simplified the planning prompt.

Together, these two commits (787d1cf and 6c7f6df) appear to be part of a
coherent effort to:
1. Simplify agent instructions
2. Freeze scope for v1 by not having agents consider new specs
3. Focus agents on implementing existing specs rather than creating new ones

No bugs or critical issues identified.
