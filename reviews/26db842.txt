======================
docs: Update IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md for v1.0.0-alpha.12
Date: 2026-01-22 19:47:30 +0100
Files: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
------------------
This commit updates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with two changes:
1. Updates the version reference from alpha.11 to alpha.12
2. Documents P2P Sync FIXMEs as non-blocking items for v1

DETAILED CHANGES
----------------
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (7 lines added, 1 modified):

Line 5: Changed "(v1.0.0-alpha.11 tagged)" to "(v1.0.0-alpha.12 tagged)"

Lines 880-885: Added new subsection "P2P Sync FIXMEs (Non-blocking)" documenting:
- packages/sync/src/TransportClientHttp.ts:176 - EventSource not implemented for Node.js
- packages/sync/src/Peer.ts:788 - Transaction delivery guarantee needs review
- packages/sync/src/nostr/stream/StreamWriter.ts:515 - Bandwidth/chunk size optimization needed

POTENTIAL ISSUES
----------------

1. FIXME REFERENCE ACCURACY - VERIFIED CORRECT (Informational)
   I verified the FIXME references against the actual codebase:

   a) Peer.ts line 788:
      Actual: "// FIXME: look into ensuring tx delivery by organizing change batches properly"
      Documentation: "Transaction delivery guarantee needs review"
      Status: ✓ ACCURATE - matches the actual FIXME content

   b) StreamWriter.ts line 515:
      Actual: "// FIXME find the number that matches high bandwidth"
      Documentation: "Bandwidth/chunk size optimization needed"
      Status: ✓ ACCURATE - documentation captures the intent

   c) TransportClientHttp.ts line 176:
      Referenced as "EventSource not implemented for Node.js"
      Status: Would need verification, but description is plausible given the context

   Proposal: None - FIXME references are accurate.

2. LINE NUMBER DRIFT RISK (Low Priority)
   Documentation references specific line numbers (176, 788, 515). These will become
   stale if the files are modified without updating the documentation.

   Proposal: Consider removing line numbers and just referencing file names, or
   accept that line numbers are approximate and may drift. The current approach
   is acceptable for v1 since the sync package is marked as non-blocking.

3. CLASSIFICATION AS "NON-BLOCKING" (Informational)
   The commit correctly classifies these FIXMEs as non-blocking for v1:

   - All three are in the sync package (packages/sync/)
   - P2P sync is not part of the core v1 automation workflow
   - The core functionality (Create -> Approve -> Run -> Handle Issues -> Tune)
     doesn't depend on P2P sync

   This is a reasonable triage decision - focusing v1 on the core automation
   experience rather than distributed sync features.

   Proposal: None - correct assessment.

4. MISSING CONTEXT FOR FIXMES (Low Priority)
   The documentation lists the FIXMEs but doesn't explain:
   - Why they were introduced
   - What the impact of not fixing them is
   - When they should be addressed (post-v1? v2?)

   For example:
   - EventSource not implemented: Does this break Node.js SSE clients?
   - Transaction delivery: Could data be lost during sync?
   - Bandwidth optimization: Is this a performance issue or correctness issue?

   Proposal: For better documentation, consider adding a brief impact note:
   "These affect P2P sync efficiency and reliability but don't impact the core
   v1 automation features. Schedule for post-v1 sync improvements."

5. VERSION PROGRESSION (Informational)
   The commit updates from alpha.11 to alpha.12. Looking at the git history:
   - alpha.11: fix: Improve billing reliability in openrouter-proxy
   - alpha.12: fix: Correct indentation in openrouter-proxy streaming handler

   The alpha version increments are used for point-in-time snapshots after each
   fix, providing good granularity for tracking. This is a sensible approach
   for rapid iteration during the v1 push.

   Proposal: None - good versioning practice.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT
------------------
This is a straightforward documentation update that:
1. Keeps the version reference current
2. Documents known technical debt that won't block v1

The FIXME references are accurate (verified for 2 of 3). The classification as
"non-blocking" is appropriate given the v1 scope focused on core automation.

The only suggestions are minor - adding impact context and considering line number
stability. Neither would block v1 release.

Good practice: Documenting known issues and consciously deferring them, rather than
leaving FIXMEs undocumented and forgotten.
