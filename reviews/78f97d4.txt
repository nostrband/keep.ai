COMMIT: 78f97d4
TITLE: Merge branch 'main' of https://github.com/nostrband/keep.ai into main
DATE: 2026-02-03 13:08:52 +0100
AUTHOR: Claude Agent

== SUMMARY ==

This is a merge commit that combines the local branch with the remote main branch.
The commit itself doesn't introduce new code - it resolves any differences between
the local and remote branches.

The merge brings in 153 files with significant changes from the remote, including:
- New execution model specs (logical items, tool migration)
- Tool migration to ToolWrapper pattern
- Error classification moved to @app/proto
- Transport client tests
- Various bug fixes and code quality improvements
- New review files

== CHANGES ==

Merge commits don't have their own diff - they combine existing commits. The changes
brought in from remote include work across multiple areas:
- packages/agent/src/sandbox/tool-wrapper.ts (new ToolWrapper infrastructure)
- packages/agent/src/tools/* (tool migrations to new interface)
- packages/db/src/item-store.ts (new ItemStore for logical items)
- packages/proto/src/errors.ts (ClassifiedError moved here)
- Many spec files in specs/done/ and specs/new/

== ISSUE REVIEW ==

No issues identified. This is a standard merge commit with no merge conflicts apparent.

The merge combines ongoing work on the execution model refactor with local changes,
which is expected during parallel development.

== PROPOSALS ==

None. Merge commits are routine operations for synchronizing branches.
