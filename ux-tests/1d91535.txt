UX TEST REPORT - Commit 1d91535
================================
Implement unified main screen with workflow list and input

Test Date: 2026-01-20
Test Environment: Local server (http://localhost:3001)
Test Tool: Playwright

COMMIT SUMMARY:
- Create MainPage.tsx combining workflow list and prompt input on single page
- Add attention banner showing count of workflows needing attention
- Compute attention state from failed runs and waiting tasks (state=wait/asks)
- Add secondary status line to workflow items showing run status
- Sort workflows by attention first, then by last activity
- Add visual attention indicator (red left border) for attention items
- Update App.tsx routing: "/" now shows MainPage, "/chat" shows old ChatPage

TEST RESULTS:

1. MAIN PAGE ROUTING
   PASS: "/" route correctly loads MainPage (verified via Playwright navigation)
   Evidence: page.url() returns "http://localhost:3001/" and shows MainPage content

2. EMPTY STATE DISPLAY
   PASS: "No automations yet" message displays when no workflows exist
   PASS: "Type below or try one of these examples" instruction visible
   Evidence: Screenshot /tmp/test-1d91535-mainpage.png

3. EXAMPLE SUGGESTIONS
   PASS: Four example automation suggestions displayed:
   - "Send me a daily summary of my unread emails"
   - "Alert me when a website changes"
   - "Remind me to drink water every 2 hours"
   - "Save interesting tweets to a note"
   Evidence: Verified via Playwright getByText() and screenshot

4. PROMPT INPUT POSITIONING
   PASS: Prompt input positioned at bottom of page
   Evidence: Input bounding box y=742 (well into bottom area of 900px viewport)
   Placeholder text: "What would you like me to help automate?"

5. INPUT TOOLBAR
   PASS: "+" button visible for file attachments
   PASS: Send button (arrow icon) visible on right
   Evidence: Screenshot /tmp/test-1d91535-mainpage.png

6. "PRESS ENTER" HINT
   PASS: "Press Enter to create automation" hint appears when text is entered
   Evidence: Screenshot /tmp/test-after-example-click.png shows hint after
   clicking example suggestion

7. ATTENTION BANNER (Code Inspection)
   NOT TESTABLE: No workflows exist to trigger attention state
   Code verified at MainPage.tsx:330-347:
   - Banner shows "{count} workflow(s) need attention"
   - Click toggles between all workflows and attention-only view

8. WORKFLOW LIST WITH ATTENTION INDICATORS (Code Inspection)
   NOT TESTABLE: No workflows exist
   Code verified at MainPage.tsx:387-391:
   - Red left border applied via: border-l-4 border-l-red-500
   - Attention items sorted first (MainPage.tsx:222-227)

ISSUES FOUND: None

NOTES:
- Could not test workflow list features (attention banner, red border, sorting)
  due to inability to create workflows without valid OpenRouter API key
- All code inspection confirms correct implementation
- UI layout and empty state behavior verified via live testing

VERDICT: PASS
All testable UX changes from commit 1d91535 work as intended.
Untested features (attention indicators) verified via code inspection.
