Message: Remove done plan

SUMMARY
-------
This commit deletes the IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md file entirely. The file contained 245 lines of documentation tracking implementation progress for the Keep.ai automation platform.

The deleted file documented:
- Priority 1: Maintainer Task Type (marked complete)
- Priority 2: Tier 1 v1 Features (dry-run testing, collapse events, highlight events, detect abandoned drafts)
- Priority 3: Tier 2 v1 Features (prompt stale drafts, archive old drafts, script versioning UI, agent status)
- Priority 4: Tier 3 v1 Features (script diff view, simplify Q&A, handle abandoned drafts)
- Priority 5: Post-v1 Features (balance/payments, in-app bug report)
- Test Coverage Gaps tracking
- Code Quality Notes
- Implementation Notes for Maintainer architecture

FILES CHANGED: 1 file, -245 lines

POTENTIAL ISSUES
----------------

ISSUE 1: Documentation Loss
Severity: Medium
Location: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (deleted)

Description: The file contained valuable context about:
- Feature completion status and history
- Architectural decisions (maintainer task type architecture section)
- Test coverage tracking
- Code quality notes (FIXMEs, skipped tests, their justifications)
- Notification types documented in one place

This information loss could make it harder for future developers to understand:
- Why certain design decisions were made
- What features are complete vs. planned
- What edge cases were considered

Proposal:
1. Instead of deleting, consider moving to docs/ or archiving
2. Or ensure key information exists elsewhere (AGENTS.md, README, individual spec files)
3. The architectural notes in "Implementation Notes" section are especially valuable

---

ISSUE 2: Premature Deletion
Severity: Low
Location: N/A

Description: This commit is immediately followed by d6db443 which moves specs back from done/ to new/, suggesting the "done" state was premature. The plan deletion may have been part of a hasty cleanup.

Proposal: Verify that all documented features are truly complete before removing tracking documents.

---

ISSUE 3: Missing Rationale
Severity: Low
Location: Commit message

Description: The commit message "Remove done plan" doesn't explain why the plan is considered "done" or why it's being removed rather than archived.

Proposal: For documentation deletions, include rationale in commit message:
- "Remove done plan: all P1-P4 features shipped, moving to CHANGELOG format"
- Or similar context

POSITIVE ASPECTS
----------------
+ Cleans up project root from stale planning documents
+ The merge commit (57349b7) included this file, so its content was captured at that point
+ Reduces maintenance burden of outdated planning documents

CONTEXTUAL NOTE
---------------
Looking at the commit history:
1. 57349b7 (13:23:16) - Merge that added IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
2. a277f2d (13:24:19) - This commit deleting it (1 minute later)
3. d6db443 (13:27:30) - Moving specs back to new/ (3 minutes later)

This rapid sequence suggests the merge may have incorrectly included completed planning docs, and this deletion is cleanup. However, the subsequent d6db443 moving specs back to new/ indicates the completion status was incorrect.

VERDICT
-------
ACCEPTABLE but could be improved.

The deletion itself is reasonable for cleanup, but:
- Key architectural documentation should be preserved elsewhere
- The rapid commit sequence suggests the merge state was incorrect
- Better rationale in commit messages would help future maintainers

RECOMMENDATION: Accept the deletion but ensure architectural notes (maintainer task type design, notification types, etc.) are captured in AGENTS.md or similar persistent documentation.
