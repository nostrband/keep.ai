================================================================================
CHANGES SUMMARY
================================================================================

This is a documentation-only commit that updates IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md with
additional details about code cleanup work that was previously completed.

FILES MODIFIED:
- IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (6 insertions, 2 deletions)

CHANGES IN DETAIL:

1. Updated "Last Updated" timestamp to include new cleanup work
   - Added "removed ~43 more lines of commented-out code" to the changelog

2. Added four new completed cleanup items under section 16 (Code Cleanup):
   - /packages/db/src/nostr-peer-store.ts - Removed unused listNostrPeerCursors() method (~10 lines)
   - /packages/agent/src/task-worker.ts - Removed unused startStatusUpdater() method (~26 lines)
   - /packages/agent/src/task-scheduler.ts - Removed deprecated getTodoTasks() references (~4 lines)
   - /packages/agent/src/index.ts - Removed unused Memory type export (~3 lines)

3. Updated total count from ~155 to ~198 lines of commented code removed

================================================================================
POTENTIAL ISSUES
================================================================================

ISSUE #1: Documentation Only - No Verification of Claims
---------------------------------------------------------
Severity: Low
Location: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

The commit claims that ~43 additional lines were removed from the listed files,
but this commit does NOT actually make those code changes - it only documents them.

Potential Problem:
- The actual code cleanup may have been done in a previous commit that was not
  properly documented
- Or the documentation may be incorrect/aspirational

Verification Needed:
- Confirm that listNostrPeerCursors() was actually removed from nostr-peer-store.ts
- Confirm that startStatusUpdater() was actually removed from task-worker.ts
- Confirm that getTodoTasks() references were actually removed from task-scheduler.ts
- Confirm that Memory type export was actually removed from index.ts

================================================================================
PROPOSALS
================================================================================

PROPOSAL #1: Verify Documentation Accuracy
------------------------------------------
Before merging documentation claims, verify the actual code changes exist:

1. Search for listNostrPeerCursors in nostr-peer-store.ts - should NOT exist
2. Search for startStatusUpdater in task-worker.ts - should NOT exist
3. Search for getTodoTasks in task-scheduler.ts - should have minimal references
4. Search for Memory type export in packages/agent/src/index.ts - should NOT exist

If any of these still exist, either:
- The documentation is premature and should be reverted
- The code cleanup was incomplete and should be finished

PROPOSAL #2: Consider Atomic Documentation Updates
--------------------------------------------------
For better traceability, documentation updates about code changes should ideally
be committed together with the actual code changes, not as separate commits.
This prevents documentation drift and makes code review easier.

================================================================================
OVERALL ASSESSMENT
================================================================================

Risk Level: LOW
Impact: Documentation only - no runtime impact

This commit is acceptable as a documentation update, but the claims should be
verified against actual codebase state. Documentation-only commits that describe
code changes are a potential sign of process issues (code and docs not being
committed atomically).

The commit itself is well-structured and follows the existing IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
format conventions.

ISSUE REVIEW
================================================================================
- Issue #1 (Documentation only - no verification of claims) - skipped (informational, doc-only commit)
