UX TEST REPORT - Commit 7251c17
================================
Update workflow status badges: Pending->Draft, Active->Running, Disabled->Paused

Test Date: 2026-01-20
Test Environment: Local server (http://localhost:3001)

COMMIT SUMMARY:
- Update status terminology in WorkflowsPage, WorkflowDetailPage, TaskDetailPage
- Change Paused badge color to yellow instead of gray
- Update toggle button text to "Pause"/"Resume"

TEST METHODOLOGY:
- Code inspection of StatusBadge.tsx, WorkflowDetailPage.tsx
- Unable to create live workflows due to test environment API key limitations

FINDINGS:

1. STATUS BADGE IMPLEMENTATION (StatusBadge.tsx:5-13)
   PASS: WorkflowStatusBadge correctly implements:
   - status === "disabled" -> Yellow badge "Paused" (bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800)
   - status === "active" -> Green badge "Running" (bg-green-100 text-green-800)
   - other/empty -> Outline badge "Draft"

2. PAUSE/RESUME BUTTON TEXT (WorkflowDetailPage.tsx:295-317)
   PASS: Button text correctly shows:
   - "Pause" when workflow.status === "active" (line 304)
   - "Resume" when workflow.status === "disabled" (line 316)

3. COLOR SCHEME VERIFICATION
   PASS: Paused badge uses yellow color scheme (bg-yellow-100 text-yellow-800)
   PASS: Running badge uses green color scheme (bg-green-100 text-green-800)
   PASS: Draft badge uses outline variant (gray border)

ISSUES FOUND: None

NOTES:
- Could not perform live visual testing of badges due to inability to create
  workflows without a valid OpenRouter API key
- Code inspection confirms all badge text and color implementations are correct
- The StatusBadge component was later extracted to a shared module (commit 89e9794)
  which maintains these same implementations

VERDICT: PASS
All UX changes from commit 7251c17 are correctly implemented.
