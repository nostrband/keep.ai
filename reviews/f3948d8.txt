Title: docs: Move completed exec specs (09-14) to done folder

FILES CHANGED:
- specs/exec-09-run-status-separation.md → specs/done/exec-09-run-status-separation.md
- specs/exec-10-retry-chain.md → specs/done/exec-10-retry-chain.md
- specs/exec-11-scheduler-state.md → specs/done/exec-11-scheduler-state.md
- specs/exec-12-failure-classification.md → specs/done/exec-12-failure-classification.md
- specs/exec-13-producer-scheduling.md → specs/done/exec-13-producer-scheduling.md
- specs/exec-14-indeterminate-mutations.md → specs/done/exec-14-indeterminate-mutations.md
- specs/exec-00-overview.md (DELETED - 205 lines)

DESCRIPTION OF CHANGES:
-----------------------
This commit performs housekeeping on specification files:

1. Moves 6 completed exec specs (09-14) from specs/ root to specs/done/ folder
2. Deletes the exec-00-overview.md file entirely (205 lines removed)

The exec-00-overview.md contained:
- Summary of exec model fix specs
- Gap analysis table (7 gaps identified)
- New specs list (exec-09 through exec-14)
- Implementation order phases
- Key decisions documentation
- Database changes summary
- Testing strategy outline

ISSUES IDENTIFIED:
------------------

### Issue 1: exec-00-overview.md deleted but not moved to done (Medium Severity)

The exec-00-overview.md file was deleted entirely rather than moved to specs/done/.
This file contained valuable context:
- Why each exec spec exists (gap analysis)
- Dependencies between specs
- Key architectural decisions made
- Database migration summary

Verification shows exec-00-overview.md DOES exist in specs/done/, so this is
actually just a misleading diff - the file was renamed/moved, not deleted.
Git shows it as delete + create because the file paths differ.

Verified: specs/done/exec-00-overview.md exists with 3.6K size.

STATUS: NOT AN ISSUE - file was moved, git diff shows as delete+create

### Issue 2: No README or index in specs/done/ folder (Low Severity)

The specs/done/ folder now contains 298 files including:
- 16 exec-*.md files (exec-00 through exec-14, plus exec-03a)
- Various feature specs, bug fix specs, and refactor specs

There is no README.md or index file to help navigate this large collection.

PROPOSALS:
----------

### Proposal 1: Add README to specs/done/ folder (Low Priority)

Create specs/done/README.md with:
- Purpose of the done folder
- Categories of specs (exec model, features, bugs, refactors)
- Quick reference to exec spec numbering scheme

Example:
```markdown
# Completed Specifications

This folder contains specifications that have been fully implemented.

## Execution Model Specs (exec-*)
- exec-00: Overview and summary
- exec-01 through exec-08: Core execution model
- exec-09 through exec-14: Scheduling and retry improvements
```

This helps new contributors understand the spec organization.

VERIFICATION:
-------------
All 6 moved spec files verified present in specs/done/:
✓ exec-09-run-status-separation.md
✓ exec-10-retry-chain.md
✓ exec-11-scheduler-state.md
✓ exec-12-failure-classification.md
✓ exec-13-producer-scheduling.md
✓ exec-14-indeterminate-mutations.md

No exec-*.md files remain in specs/ root (correct).

SUMMARY:
--------
Clean housekeeping commit that moves completed specs to the done folder. The commit
message accurately describes the changes. The deletion shown in the diff for
exec-00-overview.md is actually a move (file exists in specs/done/).

The 905 tests passing claim in the commit message aligns with verification status
in other documentation.

RISK LEVEL: None (file organization only)
RECOMMENDATION: Merge as-is
