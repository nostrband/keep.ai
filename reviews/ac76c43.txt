docs: Document type error fixes in agent tool tests
Date: 2026-01-22 18:25:35 +0100
Files: IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md

SUMMARY OF CHANGES
------------------
This commit adds documentation to IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md describing the type error
fix that was made in commit 0243571. It documents:
- The issue: AI SDK tool execute signature changed to require ToolCallOptions
- Files fixed: utility-tools.test.ts and note-tools.test.ts
- Changes made: createToolCallOptions() helper, EvalContext type change, type casts
- Verification: Type-check and tests pass, tagged v1.0.0-alpha.9

DETAILED CHANGES
----------------
IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md (22 lines added):
- Added new section "Type Error Fixes in Agent Tool Tests (2026-01-22)"
- Documents the issue found (AI SDK signature change)
- Lists files fixed with absolute paths
- Describes the four changes made
- Notes verification results (21 type tasks, 216 + 37 tests)
- Mentions the resulting alpha tag (v1.0.0-alpha.9)

POTENTIAL ISSUES
----------------

1. ABSOLUTE PATHS IN DOCUMENTATION (Low Priority)
   The documentation uses absolute paths:
   - /home/artur/keep.ai/packages/tests/src/utility-tools.test.ts
   - /home/artur/keep.ai/packages/tests/src/note-tools.test.ts

   While accurate, absolute paths with user-specific home directories are not ideal
   for documentation that might be read by other developers or in different environments.

   Proposal: Change to relative paths from repo root:
   - packages/tests/src/utility-tools.test.ts
   - packages/tests/src/note-tools.test.ts

2. DOCUMENTATION-CODE CONSISTENCY (Informational)
   The documentation accurately reflects the code changes in commit 0243571:
   - ToolCallOptions helper: ✓ Correct
   - EvalContext type change: ✓ Correct
   - Type casts for arrays: ✓ Correct
   - Second argument passing: ✓ Correct

   Proposal: None - documentation is accurate.

3. ALPHA TAG REFERENCE (Informational)
   Documentation states the fix resulted in v1.0.0-alpha.9. This is useful for
   tracking which version includes this fix. The sequential alpha versioning
   (alpha.1 through alpha.41) provides good granularity for tracking progress.

   Proposal: None - good practice to reference tags.

4. SECTION PLACEMENT (Low Priority)
   The new section is added at the end of the document before "Implementation Notes".
   This follows the pattern of other date-stamped documentation sections. The
   chronological ordering makes it easy to find recent changes.

   However, there's no table of contents or index for these sections, which could
   make navigation difficult as the document grows.

   Proposal: Consider adding a "Recent Changes" index at the top of the document
   linking to date-stamped sections. Not critical for v1.

OVERALL ASSESSMENT
------------------
This is straightforward documentation that accurately describes the preceding code fix.
The only minor issue is the use of absolute paths, which should be changed to relative
paths for better portability.

The documentation serves its purpose of creating an audit trail for the fix and
providing context for anyone reviewing the changes later.

No issues that would block v1 release.
